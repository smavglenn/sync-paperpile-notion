  abstract  = "This paper identifies initiatives related to corporate social
               responsibility (CSR) in the airline industry and evaluates the
               overall state of their adoption as reported by members of the
               three largest airline alliances. Of 41 airlines, only 14 had
               annual CSR reports publically available in January 2009. Reports
               were analyzed using a qualitative content analysis approach.
               Results showed a stronger focus on environmental issues than on
               the social or economic dimensions of CSR. Of the seven major
               environmental themes examined, emission reduction programs
               predominate. Other environmental issues receive much less
               attention, with no single other initiative implemented by all
               airlines. Four social and environmental themes were found,
               including employee wellbeing and engagement, diversity and
               social equity, community wellbeing and economic prosperity. The
               data analysis supported the arguments made in the literature
               that the airlines report CSR initiatives using differing or
               inconsistent measurements, making evaluation and comparison of
               their performance and effectiveness difficult. Although a large
               number of airlines publishing CSR reports discussed their
               achievement of major goals (reduction of emissions, increasing
               community involvement or increasing workforce diversity), a much
               smaller number provided detailed information relating to
               specific initiatives implemented in order to contribute to these
               goals. Further, important issues for CSR research are posed in
               the paper.",

               mobilization of capital markets. By 2035, more than \$53
               trillion will need to be invested in energy supply and
               efficiency in order to achieve climate targets laid out in the
               2015 Paris Agreement. Interest and participation in sustainable
               finance continues to grow: environmental, social, and governance
               (ESG) investing assets under management totaled \$30.7 trillion
               (of which \$1 trillion is specifically classified as
               sustainability-themed) at the start of 2018, representing a 34\%

               available for investment in sustainable assets may not be
               well-matched with the pipeline of projects in search of
               financing. Green asset classes, including renewable generation,
               infrastructure, energy efficiency, and clean transport, are
               often inherently novel, small, and/or disaggregated. This makes
               them difficult and expensive to combine into investment-ready

               education institutions (HEIs) can use a successful campus
               infrastructure project to fund a student- and faculty-led,
               community-success platform that advances the sustainable
               development goals (SDGs).Design/methodology/approach The authors
               applied conceptual models for systems thinking and creating
               virtuous cycles to analyze Millersville University's work to
               establish a community-impact, micro-grant fund using cost
               savings and utility rebates associated with a new campus
               zero-energy building. The analysis provides a case study that
               other HEIs can implement to create university and community
               virtuous cycles that advance the SDGs.Findings The case study
               suggests that as HEIs face increasing financial challenges,
               opportunities exist to capitalize on philanthropic giving and
               other funding sources to support community prosperity and
               increase university vitality through a shared responsibility
               paradigm centered on the SDGs.Practical implications This case
               study identifies specific funding sources that HEIs can use to
               fund campus and community sustainability projects using the SDG
               framework, mechanisms for establishing shared purpose around
               that impact and a conceptual model for thinking about
               opportunities to leverage philanthropic giving to create a
               virtuous cycle that increases university vitality through
               community impact.Social implications Constructing a campus zero
               energy building funded in part through philanthropic giving
               provided a unique opportunity to explore how a project's success
               can be leveraged to create additional community successes. This
               case study offers an example for how to convert one success into
               a platform that funds projects that have direct community impact
               in one or more of the SDG goal areas.Originality/value This
               paper aims at bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks
               for community sustainable development and descriptive-only case
               studies by using a case study to demonstrate a conceptual model
               or framework for advancing community sustainability
               (Karatzoglou, 2013). The case study provides a unique model for
               using utility rebates associated with an infrastructure project
               that was funded through philanthropic giving to establish a fund
               for projects that support the community. Utility rebates
               associated with campus energy efficiency projects are often
               otherwise overlooked, used to fund additional energy efficiency
               projects or simply returned to a university's operating budget.
               For some HEIs, this model may connect the work of facilities
               staff to student success in ways that have not previously been
               explored. For others, this alternative use of utility rebates
               may offer an opportunity to increase the investment value of
               utility rebate dollars by creating virtuous cycles within their
               communities that contribute to university vitality.",

              planning and tracking the technical, managerial and behavioral
              changes that are consistent with the Paris Agreement.
              Nevertheless, roadmaps and pathways for decarbonization often
              gloss over a fundamental question: `How do deliberate social
              transformations happen?' Often the social complexity of
              transformation processes is downplayed or ignored in favor of
              technical solutions and behavioral approaches. In this article, I
              explain why they are incomplete and unlikely to `bend the curves'
              to reduce emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement. I
              first discuss the distinction between technical and adaptive
              challenges and why this is relevant. I then review and describe
              the dynamics of social change in relation to three related and
              interacting `spheres' of transformation: the practical,
              political, and personal spheres. Finally, I explore how these
              three spheres can be used to identify leverage points for

               challenges highlight the need to rethink the current way of
               doing business. Human and business activities rely on
               functioning social-ecological systems but tend to take these for
               granted. Extant research on business sustainability has
               acknowledged the relevance of sustainability concerns for
               business strategy and organizing. Yet, dominant
               conceptualizations of business sustainability remain focused on
               the organization and its business case, in the quest to find
               strategies that translate less harmful social and environmental
               practices into competitive advantages. Only few scholars have
               gone beyond such a commercial logic and adopted a systems
               approach to derive business strategies from the logic of
               social-ecological systems. In this article, we propose that
               taking a systems approach means to conceptualize business
               sustainability in terms of regenerative business, that is,
               businesses that enhance, and thrive through, the health of
               social-ecological systems in a co-evolutionary process. As our
               main contribution, we develop the restore-preserve-enhance scale
               for regenerative business strategies reflecting a continuum of
               strategies for regeneration. These strategies follow from two
               main principles and related criteria for a systems-based level
               of aspiration and an adaptive management approach to
               regeneration. By doing so, we fundamentally shift the focus away
               from a business logic to a systems logic. Importantly, we offer
               concrete strategies for organizations to contribute to
               life-supporting conditions in social-ecological systems.",

  abstract  = "[We present a model of technological adaptation in response to a
               change in climate conditions. The main feature of the model is
               that new technologies are not just risky, but also ambiguous.
               Pessimistic agents are thus averse to adopting a new technology.
               Learning is induced by optimists, who are willing to try out
               technologies about which there is little evidence available. We
               show that both optimists and pessimists are crucial for a
               successful adaptation. While optimists provide the public good
               of information which gives pessimists an incentive to innovate,
               pessimists choose the new technology persistently in the
               long-run which increases the average returns for the society.
               Hence, the optimal share of optimists in the society is strictly
               positive. When the share of optimists in the society is too low,
               innovation is slow and the obtained steady-state is inefficient.
               We discuss two policies which can potentially alleviate this
               inefficiency: Subsidies and provision of additional information.
               We show that if precise and relevant information is available,
               pessimists would be willing to pay for it and consequently adopt
               the new technology. Hence, providing information might be a more
               efficient policy, which is both self-financing and results in
               better social outcomes.]",

  abstract = "In the debate on climate change commentators often express
              pessimistic or optimistic views. We see this mainly in the media
              and popular literature, but also in various academic fields. The
              aim of this paper is to investigate different kinds of
              pessimistic and optimistic views put forward in this debate and
              suggest explanations of the diversity of views. The paper
              concludes that pessimism and optimism may concern, for example,
              climate change as an unmitigated or poorly mitigated process,
              mitigation of climate change or specific measures of mitigation.
              These aspects are important to distinguish, because a person can
              be pessimist concerning climate change as an unmitigated or
              poorly mitigated process and optimist concerning mitigation of
              climate change, and be pessimist concerning one specific
              mitigation measure and optimist concerning another. It is
              suggested that the diversity of pessimistic and optimistic views
              is due to the uncertainty of scientific climate models and the
              influence of evaluative and ideological assumptions.",

  abstract  = "[ABSTRACT. Global environmental change requires responses that
               involve marked or qualitative changes in individuals,
               institutions, societies, and cultures. Yet, while there has been
               considerable effort to develop theory about such processes,
               there has been limited research on practices for facilitating
               transformative change. We present a novel pathways approach
               called Three Horizons that helps participants work with complex
               and intractable problems and uncertain futures. The approach is
               important for helping groups work with uncertainty while also
               generating agency in ways not always addressed by existing
               futures approaches. We explain how the approach uses a simple
               framework for structured and guided dialogue around different
               patterns of change by using examples. We then discuss some of
               the key characteristics of the practice that facilitators and
               participants have found to be useful. This includes (1)
               providing a simple structure for working with complexity, (2)
               helping develop future consciousness (an awareness of the future
               potential in the present moment), (3) helping distinguish
               between incremental and transformative change, (4) making
               explicit the processes of power and patterns of renewal, (5)
               enabling the exploration of how to manage transitions, and (6)
               providing a framework for dialogue among actors with different
               mindsets. The complementarity of Three Horizons to other
               approaches (e.g., scenario planning, dilemma thinking) is then
               discussed. Overall, we highlight that there is a need for much
               greater attention to researching practices of transformation in
               ways that bridge different kinds of knowledge, including
               episteme and phronesis. Achieving this will itself require
               changes to contemporary systems of knowledge production. The
               practice of Three Horizons could be a useful way to explore how
               such transformations in knowledge production and use could be
               achieved.]",

               fundamental change to address contemporary global challenges can
               be facilitated. This paper contributes to discussions about
               transformation by providing a social science, arts and
               humanities perspective to open up discussion and set out a
               research agenda about what it means to transform and the
               dimensions, limitations and possibilities for transformation.
               Key focal areas include: (1) change theories; (2) knowing
               whether transformation has occurred or is occurring; (3)
               knowledge production and use; (4) governance; (5) how dimensions
               of social justice inform transformation; (6) the limits of human
               nature; (7) the role of the utopian impulse; (8) working with
               the present to create new futures; and (9) human consciousness.
               In addition to presenting a set of research questions around
               these themes the paper highlights that much deeper engagement
               with complex social processes is required; that there are vast
               opportunities for social science, humanities and the arts to
               engage more directly with the climate challenge; that there is a
               need for a massive upscaling of efforts to understand and shape
               desired forms of change; and that, in addition to helping answer
               important questions about how to facilitate change, a key role
               of the social sciences, humanities and the arts in addressing
               climate change is to critique current societal patterns and to
               open up new thinking. Through such critique and by being more

               opportunities will be provided for opening up a dialogue about

  abstract = "Current societies cannot stay the same forever in the face of the
              strength of global forces like climate change. The question is
              thus not whether to change, but how system transitions and
              transformational change can be stewarded towards different kinds
              of futures. Using a simple heuristic called Three Horizons, this
              paper explores the dynamics of four common archetypes of system
              transition and transformation: Smooth Transitions, Capture and
              Extension, Collapse and Renewal, and Investment Bubbles. Smooth
              Transitions are relatively rare. The others are much more
              pervasive, tend to delay transition, and often produce
              undesirable effects. Understanding the dynamics and causes of the
              different archetypes generates six critical lessons for
              stewarding transformations. These are the need to: 1) Maintain
              transformational intent; 2) Navigate all archetypes
              simultaneously; 3) Attend to an interplay of three different
              patterns of innovation (sustaining, disruptive, transforming); 4)
              Work with three mindsets and orientations to the future (manager,
              entrepreneur, and visionary); 5) Establish four active modes of
              governance; and 6) Actively build capacities for transformational
              stewardship. The archetypes confirm others' findings that
              systemic conditions are critical in shaping opportunities for
              effective leadership. Yet they also suggest that how such
              conditions arise is partly determined by the way transformation
              is understood as a qualitatively distinct form of change and the
              availability of transformational approaches to leadership. To
              more rapidly advance understanding of how to steward system
              transition, research needs greater focus on marrying insights
              from larger scale system change studies with insights from those
              attempting to steward change on the ground and in practice.",

              of adverse health consequences, and the policy frameworks that
              are intended to protect vulnerable populations from inappropriate
              e-waste recycling practices. FINDINGS: The amount of e-waste
              being generated is increasing rapidly and is compounded by both
              illegal exportation and inappropriate donation of electronic
              equipment, especially computers, from developed to developing
              countries. As little as 25\% of e-waste is recycled in formal
              recycling centers with adequate worker protection. The health
              consequences of both direct exposures during recycling and
              indirect exposures through environmental contamination are
              potentially severe but poorly studied. Policy frameworks aimed at
              protecting vulnerable populations exist but are not effectively
              applied. CONCLUSIONS: E-waste recycling is necessary but it
              should be conducted in a safe and standardized manor. The
              acceptable risk thresholds for hazardous, secondary e-waste
              substances should not be different for developing and developed
              countries. However, the acceptable thresholds should be different
              for children and adults given the physical differences and
              pronounced vulnerabilities of children. Improving occupational
              conditions for all e-waste workers and striving for the
              eradication of child labor is non-negotiable.",

              that includes consumers, business, government, the environment,
              and economic and political relations between nations, we explore
              how sustainability should affect the consumption behavior of
              consumers, charitable aid to poorer countries, and responsible
              environmental practices by businesses. Our model enables us to
              provide normative implications for consumers, society and
              business. Importantly, we assume that all stakeholders will
              optimize their self-interest, and that altruism will only partly
              explain behavior consistent with sustainability. Among the more
              non-obvious findings are that (1) the poorer the poor countries
              are, the less the rich countries should consume, (2) the more
              sensitive the global political climate is to economic inequity
              between the rich and poor nations, the less the rich countries
              should consume, and (3) if aid to poor countries is effective
              enough, then the more materialistic the society is, the more
              charitable aid it should give. We also confirm a number of more
              intuitive findings, such as that business should use more green
              technology as the taxes on pollution and/or efficiency of green
              technology increase, and the more resource-intensive consumption
              is, the less consumers should consume. Taken as a whole, the

               food and energy crises---it is necessary to employ a broad
               historical view. While existing problems have distinctive
               features, the underlying causes, which stem from the structure
               of the world-system, are not novel to this or the previous
               century. We assert that it is useful to distinguish between
               three tiers of time in order to recognize the various forces,
               systems, and processes that operate within the world. The global
               capitalist system, which operates on the second tier, acts as a
               form of ``social gravity'' that is pervasive and constant. Too
               often, it goes unnoticed or is simply assumed to be immutable.
               As a result, mainstream thinkers focus on the particularities of
               environmental problems and offer ``solutions'' (such as energy
               efficiency, new sources of energy, and other technological
               fixes) that fail to address or solve the original problems.
               Often attempts to solve one problem generate new problems, given
               specific shifts in the capitalist system and its technical
               regimes. To overcome modern environmental crises will require

               The enhancement of albedo would be achieved by intentionally
               injecting sulfur into the stratosphere. The rational for
               proposing the experiment is the observed cooling of the
               atmosphere following the recent major volcanic eruptions by El
               Chichon in 1984 and Mount Pinatubo in 1991 (Hansen et al.,

              It presents the views of research professionals inside government
              on the apparent stand-off between proponents of behavioural
              economics and adopters of social practice theory in academic
              energy research. Drawing on auto-ethnographic insights and
              interviews with government social researchers (GSRs) working on

  author    = "Hickel, Jason",
  abstract  = "Sustainable Development. 2019;1--12. Abstract There are two
               sides to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which appear
               at risk of contradiction. One calls for humanity to achieve
               ``harmony with nature'' and to protect the planet from
               degradation, with specific targets laid out in Goals 6, 12, 13,
               14, and 15. The other calls for continued global economic growth
               equivalent to 3\% per year, as outlined in Goal 8, as a method
               for achieving human development objectives. The SDGs assume that
               efficiency improvements will suffice to reconcile the tension
               between growth and ecological sustainability. This paper draws
               on empirical data to test whether this assumption is valid,
               paying particular attention to two key ecological indicators:
               resource use and CO2 emissions. The results show that global
               growth of 3\% per year renders it empirically infeasible to
               achieve (a) any reductions in aggregate global resource use and
               (b) reductions in CO2 emissions rapid enough to stay within the
               carbon budget for 2°C. In other words, Goal 8 violates the
               sustainability objectives of the SDGs. The paper proposes
               specific changes to SDG targets in order to resolve this issue,
               such as removing the requirement of aggregate global growth and
               introducing quantified objectives for resource use per capita
               with substantial reductions in high‐income nations. Scaling down
               resource use is also the most feasible way to achieve the
               climate target, as it reduces energy demand. The paper presents
               alternative pathways for realizing human development objectives
               that rely on reducing inequality---both within nations and
               between them---rather than aggregate growth.",

              subsidies are encouraging the ethanol program without substantial
              benefits to the U.S. economy. Large ethanol industries and a few
              U.S. government agencies, such as the USDA, support the
              production of ethanol. Corn-farmers receive minimal profits. In
              the U.S. ethanol system, considerably more energy, including
              high-grade fossil fuel, is required to produce ethanol than is
              available in the energy-ethanol output. Specifically about 29\%
              more energy is used to produce a gallon of ethanol than the
              energy in a gallon of ethanol. Fossil energy powers corn
              production and the fermentation/distillation processes.
              Increasing subsidized ethanol production will take more feed from
              livestock production, and is estimated to currently cost
              consumers an additional $1 billion per year. Ethanol production
              increases environmental degradation. Corn production causes more
              total soil erosion than any other crop. Also, corn production
              uses more insecticides, herbicides, and nitrogen fertilizers than
              any other crop. All these factors degrade the agricultural and
              natural environment and contribute to water pollution and air
              pollution. Increasing the cost of food and diverting human food
              resources to the costly inefficient production of ethanol fuel
              raise major ethical questions. These occur at a time when more
              than half of the world's population is malnourished. The ethical
              priority for corn and other food crops should be for food and
              feed. Subsidized ethanol produced from U.S. corn is not a
              renewable energy source.",

  abstract = "Natural processes and human activities produce vast amounts of
              dead vegetation which return CO2 to the atmosphere through decay
              and combustion. If such vegetation could be converted into
              biocoal and sequestered on the ocean floor, it could reduce the
              accumulation of atmospheric CO2 without involving sequestration
              in the form of CO2. Given that raw vegetation is unsuitable for
              large-scale energy applications, a process was developed to
              convert raw vegetation into a form of biocoal, termed Black
              Pellets, that solves the logistical and energy conversion
              problems of using raw vegetation for power generation. Seemingly
              overlooked is that properties of Black Pellets---higher density
              than seawater and resistance to microbial decay---may offer an
              environmentally safe way of sequestering vegetation carbon on the
              sea floor. Sequestering vegetation carbon by depositing biocoal
              as Black Pellets in the deep ocean (oceanic sequestration of
              biocoal---OSB) would be a means of achieving long-lasting
              negative emissions. Sacrificing the energy content of the
              deposited pellets would require substituting energy from other
              sources. If the substitute energy could be from lower-carbon
              natural gas or carbon-free sources, the effects would be less
              accumulation of atmospheric CO2 compared to using the pellets for
              energy and a nearly 60 to 100\% reduction in the need for
              geologic sequestration compared to bioenergy carbon capture and
              storage (BECCS). If confirmed by research, OSB would be an
              addition to the sparse toolbox of negative emission technologies
              (NETs) which would give humankind more flexibility in meeting the

  abstract = "Bioenergy is the most widely used type of renewable energy. A
              drawback of crops applied for bioenergy is that they compete with
              food and use the same natural resources like water. From a
              natural resources perspective, it would be more efficient to
              apply the large potential of available crop residues. In this
              paper, we calculate the water footprint (WF) of ten crop residue
              types and a few other second-generation bioenergy feedstocks
              (miscanthus, eucalyptus and pine). Further we estimate the WF of
              energy carriers produced through different conversion techniques
              (heat or electricity from combustion and gasification, bioethanol
              from fermentation and oil from pyrolysis), using the global WF
              standard. The WFs of crop residues, miscanthus and wood show a
              large variation. Crop residues have a smaller WF than miscanthus
              and wood. Given a certain feedstock, the WF of pyrolysis oil is
              smaller than the WF of bioethanol from fermentation. The WFs of
              heat from combustion or gasification are similar. The WF of
              electricity by combustion ranges from 33 to 324 m3/GJ and the WF
              of electricity by gasification from 21 to 104 m3/GJ. This
              research concludes that it is relatively water-efficient to apply
              crop residues, and that the production of miscanthus and wood for
              bioenergy is less favourable. Crop residues can best be converted
              to oil rather than to ethanol. Electricity from gasification has
              a smaller WF than electricity form combustion; heat from
              combustion has a smaller WF than heat from gasification. By
              showing the water efficiency of different feedstocks and
              techniques to produce second-generation bioenergy, the study
              provides a useful basis to wisely choose amongst different

              principally considered as meat substitutes. Nevertheless, in
              Western countries, meat substitute consumption is actually very
              low, principally due to food neophobia and poor sensory qualities
              in comparison with meat. In insect particular case, food
              neophobia is clearly high. To reduce insect food neophobia,
              previous studies suggest to insert invisible insect in food
              preparation and/or to associate them with known flavors. In this
              study, a survey on entomophagy perception and hedonic tests were
              realized to assess the level of sensory-liking of hybrid
              insect-based burgers (beef, lentils, mealworms and beef,
              mealworms and lentils). Participants' overall liking of the four
              burgers differed between genders and was influenced by burger
              appearance and taste. Women clearly preferred beef burger
              appearance, whereas men preferred the appearance of beef and
              insect-based burgers. Concerning insect-based burger taste,
              participants (men and women) rated it intermediately, between
              that of the beef and lentil burger, with a preference for the
              mealworm and beef burger. Results also showed that people with
              previous entomophagy experience was limited but that they gave
              globally higher ratings to all preparations. In conclusion,
              insect tasting sessions are important to decrease food neophobia,
              as they encourage people to ``take the first step'' and become

              environmental) sustainability, commonly represented by three
              intersecting circles with overall sustainability at the centre,
              has become ubiquitous. With a view of identifying the genesis and
              theoretical foundations of this conception, this paper reviews
              and discusses relevant historical sustainability literature. From
              this we find that there is no single point of origin of this
              three-pillar conception, but rather a gradual emergence from
              various critiques in the early academic literature of the
              economic status quo from both social and ecological perspectives
              on the one hand, and the quest to reconcile economic growth as a
              solution to social and ecological problems on the part of the
              United Nations on the other. The popular three circles diagram
              appears to have been first presented by Barbier (Environ Conserv
              14:101, doi: 10.1017/s0376892900011449, 1987), albeit purposed
              towards developing nations with foci which differ from modern
              interpretations. The conceptualisation of three pillars seems to
              predate this, however. Nowhere have we found a theoretically
              rigorous description of the three pillars. This is thought to be
              in part due to the nature of the sustainability discourse arising
              from broadly different schools of thought historically. The
              absence of such a theoretically solid conception frustrates

              suffers from the negative impact due to environmental pollution
              caused by tannery wastes produced during leather processing
              processes. The tanning processes contribute significantly to
              chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solids (TDS),
              chlorides, sulfates and heavy metal pollution. The chemicals
              discharged into aquatic systems end up in highly polluted
              sediments and salinisation of rivers. European Chemical Agency
              (ECHA) has prioritized some of the hazardous chemicals used in
              leather under Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) and
              substances for Authorization. The situation has highlighted the
              need for greener technologies. Out of the two broad categories of
              technical methods, the first group involves the introduction of
              processing technologies by decreasing the effluent pollution
              load, avoiding the use of harmful chemicals and producing solid
              wastes that can be used as by-products. The other category is
              related to the treatment of wastewater, handling and processing
              of solid waste in an environment-friendly manner. Both methods
              have been applied to prevent negative impact on the environment
              during leather production. The methods have been reviewed for
              their technical suitability and commercial feasibility and it was
              felt that combination of both is essential. The technologies can
              have up-front additional costs but have to be balanced against

              on the topic of the acceptance, adoption, use, or diffusion of

              and methods before honing in on a combination of fourteen
              theories deemed most relevant and useful by the material. These
              are: Sociotechnical Transitions, Social Practice Theory,

              Social Construction of Technology, Sociotechnical Imaginaries,

  abstract = "Architects, artists and engineers around the world have been
              experimenting with the potential of mycelium, the vegetative body
              of a fungus, as a future building material for the past 15 years.
              It shares many of the positive material attributes of polystyrene
              but unlike the synthetic material it is fully sustainable and
              completely biodegradable. Mycelium has also proved to be simple
              to grow at scale. Its capacity to rapidly grow its tangled hyphae
              in a multiplicity of directions, digesting nothing more than
              organic waste, has shown promise for the production of a variety
              of materials for the building industry. But despite this,
              mycelium has struggled to find a market within the building
              industry. Drawing on the literature, this article argues that the
              challenges have been psychological, aesthetic and economic,
              rather than technical. Western industrial systems have
              conditioned us to expect material cultures to be clean, precise
              and durable. Mycelium is messy and some fungi are known
              pathogens. Like any living creature it can be unpredictable.
              Further, while the materials for growing mycelium are cheap,
              initial production costs for mass production and distribution
              typical of industrial fabrication are high. The risk for
              investors in the absence of an assured market stymied early
              forays into production. But as the environmental crisis becomes
              more urgent, there is evidence of a growing interest in finding
              new avenues for production. Centralised large-scale production is
              only one way forward. Another, which learns from early failures,
              is mass production through a multiplicity of micro-scale,
              do-it-yourself systems.",

              characterized by widespread operations across both developing and

              environmental problems in developing countries, companies
              increasingly focus on sustainability and try to ensure the same
              quality and standards in working and production conditions

  abstract = "This dissertation expands upon the relatively new theory of
              performance and ecology within the larger field of ecocriticism,
              or what has come to be called ``ecodramaturgy.'' With climate
              change, globalization, and issues of sustainability much on the
              minds of citizens, politicians, the media, and artists, the time
              is ripe for performance-makers to keep the momentum of this
              international outlook going and to move it forward by producing
              theatrical events that capture the public's imagination,
              stimulate the popular consciousness, and catalyze the national
              conversation about climate change. Embodied and imaginative
              ecological performance practices are poised to shift the
              paradigms of human-nature relations and to change audience
              perceptions of themselves by stirring the collective imagination
              towards a deeper sense of our material embeddedness in the
              more-than-human world.The dissertation argues that by rejecting
              wholly anthropocentric perspectives and, instead, staging and
              affirming non-hierarchical relationships between nature and
              humans, ecological performances deconstruct the distinctions
              between human/animal, actor/spectator, culture/nature,
              performed/everyday life and, in doing so, have the power to
              produce responsive participants in ecological action. The urgent
              call here is for a rigorous, imaginative ecological discourse in
              performance and performance studies that brings into focus a
              sense of environmental world citizenship and an
              ecologically-based advocacy on behalf of greater
              socio-environmental justice.The theater's agile ability to move
              effortlessly between metaphor and physical presence reveals its
              power to be a particularly apt medium to tell stories in ways
              that can activate shifts in perception and action. I have chosen
              plays and performance events, therefore, that are particularly
              poetic and metaphorical while they are, at the same time,
              entirely wrapped up in the material-ecological situatedness of
              their stories. This project looks at performances from the 1990s
              through 2012 that directly engage with issues of the urban
              landscape and globalization; that intentionally explore the
              material relationships between bodies and the detritus of
              environmental waste or the effects of global warming; that
              advocate for a felt, phenomenological connection to the earth; or
              that explicitly reveal the damaging effects of political violence
              on bodies, the land, and on the community. The dissertation
              argues that an ecological consciousness at work in performance
              and performance scholarship troubles the prevailing human/nature
              split by locating humans and the more-than-human world in a
              mutually reliant system.The scope of this analysis takes in
              ecologically aware performance-making that includes dance,
              theater, performance art, and devised theater, all of which
              productively engage with the idea of performance as iterated
              activity through which variation, difference, agency, and
              spontaneity emerge in creative moments of exchange. This notion
              of an ever-evolving sense of performance allows for fluid,
              creative, relational moments that encompass the human and the
              more-than-human world.",

  abstract  = "For more than three decades, Ben \& Jerry's has been committed
               to an insanely ambitious three-part mission: not just making the
               world's best ice cream but also supporting progressive causes
               and sharing its success with all stakeholders---employees,
               suppliers, distributors, customers, cows, everybody. Living up
               to these beliefs is fun when you're doing it right, and it
               creates amazingly loyal customers, but it isn't easy. This is
               the first book to tell the full, inside story of the inspiring
               rise, tragic mistakes, devastating fall, determined recovery,
               and ongoing renewal of one of the most iconic mission-driven
               companies in the world. No previous book has focused so intently
               on the challenges presented by staying true to the mission as
               the business grew. No other book has explained how the company
               came to be sold to Unilever, one of the world's biggest
               corporations. And none has described the unprecedented contract
               Ben \& Jerry's negotiated with Unilever to preserve the
               three-part mission or the complex working relationship that has
               allowed the company to pursue that mission on a much larger
               stage. Brad Edmondson tells the story with a journalist's eye
               for details, dramatic moments, and memorable characters. Among
               the dozens of key figures Edmondson interviewed, his most
               important source was Jeff Furman, who helped Ben and Jerry write
               their first business plan in 1978 and has stayed involved ever
               since, serving as chairman of the board since 2010. It's a
               funny, sad, surprising, and ultimately hopeful story. ``Just as
               Ben \& Jerry's is no ordinary business, this is no ordinary
               business book. It's fast paced; it has compelling, fully
               realized characters; and the narrative is gripping. I couldn't
               put the book down. That made it difficult to eat my Cherry
               Garcia at the same time.'' ---from the foreword by Annie

  author   = "Porter, Michael E and Kramer, Mark R",
  abstract = "Governments, activists, and the media have become adept at
              holding companies to account for the social consequences of their
              actions. In response, corporate social responsibility has emerged
              as an inescapable priority for business leaders in every country.
              Frequently, though, CSR efforts are counterproductive, for two
              reasons. First, they pit business against society, when in
              reality the two are interdependent. Second, they pressure
              companies to think of corporate social responsibility in generic
              ways instead of in the way most appropriate to their individual
              strategies. The fact is, the prevailing approaches to CSR are so
              disconnected from strategy as to obscure many great opportunities
              for companies to benefit society. What a terrible waste. If
              corporations were to analyze their opportunities for social
              responsibility using the same frameworks that guide their core
              business choices, they would discover, as Whole Foods Market,
              Toyota, and Volvo have done, that CSR can be much more than a
              cost, a constraint, or a charitable deed--it can be a potent
              source of innovation and competitive advantage. In this article,
              Michael Porter and Mark Kramer propose a fundamentally new way to
              look at the relationship between business and society that does
              not treat corporate growth and social welfare as a zero-sum game.
              They introduce a framework that individual companies can use to
              identify the social consequences of their actions; to discover
              opportunities to benefit society and themselves by strengthening
              the competitive context in which they operate; to determine which
              CSR initiatives they should address; and to find the most
              effective ways of doing so. Perceiving social responsibility as
              an opportunity rather than as damage control or a PR campaign
              requires dramatically different thinking--a mind-set, the authors
              warn, that will become increasingly important to competitive
              success.",

               Young potential entrepreneurs talk about exit strategies before
               even creating an innovation or starting a business. Our
               innovation ecosystems push them to do so in many ways. Seemingly

               away from creating long?term societally beneficial innovations.
               We argue that this hypergrowth exit mindset is destroying
               societal wellbeing due to its laser focus on increasing socially
               constructed exit value above all else. As a field we need much

              published in 2013. The release of version 3 introduced several
